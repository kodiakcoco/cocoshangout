# Deploying to Heroku Using Git and Heroku CLI

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your project to Heroku using Git and the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone your project's repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Create a Heroku Account

If you don't have a Heroku account, [sign up here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

### 3. Log in to Heroku

Log in to your Heroku account using the Heroku CLI:

```sh
heroku login
```

This will open a browser window where you can enter your Heroku credentials.

### 4. Create a New Heroku App

Create a new app on Heroku:

```sh
heroku create your-app-name
```

Replace `your-app-name` with your desired application name. Heroku will also generate a random name if you leave this blank.

### 5. Add Heroku Remote

Add the Heroku remote to your Git repository:

```sh
git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git
```

Replace `your-app-name` with the name of your Heroku app.

### 6. Prepare Your Application for Deployment

Ensure your project has the necessary files for Heroku deployment, such as a `Procfile` and any environment-specific configurations. Here's an example `Procfile` for a Python web application:

```Procfile
web: gunicorn your_project.wsgi
```

### 7. Deploy to Heroku

Deploy your application to Heroku by pushing your code to the Heroku remote:

```sh
git push heroku main
```

If your default branch is `master`, use the following command instead:

```sh
git push heroku master
```

### 8. Run Database Migrations (if applicable)

If your application uses a database and requires migrations, run them on Heroku:

```sh
heroku run python manage.py migrate
```

### 9. Open Your Application

Open your deployed application in the web browser:

```sh
heroku open
```

### 10. Monitor Your Application

You can monitor your application's logs using the Heroku CLI:

```sh
heroku logs --tail
```

## Additional Tips

- **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables using the Heroku CLI:

  ```sh
  heroku config:set YOUR_ENV_VAR=value
  ```

- **Scaling**: Scale your application by adjusting the number of dynos:

  ```sh
  heroku ps:scale web=1
  ```

- **Add-ons**: Add add-ons (like databases) to your application:

  ```sh
  heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
  ```

## Conclusion

Your application should now be up and running on Heroku! If you encounter any issues, refer to the [Heroku Dev Center](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) for more detailed documentation and support.
